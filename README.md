# CSS JS Animation Demo
A demo application designed to compare user experience during a stress test of animations using both CSS and JavaScript

## Installation
* Clone repo to local directory
* Run `npm install`

## Usage in Browser
* Run `npm start`
* Navigate to http://localhost:8080
* _Start Animation_ buttons on the bottom of the screen will randomly be assigned an animation type on load
* Run both animations to see if there is a user noticable difference between the animations
* Open console to view what button controls each animation

## The Animation
* The animation is a rain scene over the hills (sorry I did the best I could with my artistic ability)
* There are 1000 raindrops each to be animated down the screen
* The animation will run on an infinite loop
* On load each _Start Animation_ button will be randomly assigned an animation to start
* When complete you can use the console to see what button was controlling each animation
